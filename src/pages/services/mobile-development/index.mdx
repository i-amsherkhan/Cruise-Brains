## React-Native 

As a software company, we considering using React Native as a framework for building mobile apps. React Native is a popular choice for building cross-platform mobile apps because it allows you to reuse a lot of your code between iOS and Android, and it provides a declarative, reactive programming model that makes it easy to build and maintain complex apps.

React Native uses a declarative programming model, which means that you describe the desired state of your app and React Native takes care of rendering the appropriate views to the screen. This makes it easy to build and maintain complex apps, as you can update the state of your app and React Native will automatically update the views to reflect the new state.

React Native also includes a rich set of built-in components that you can use to build your app's user interface. These components include things like buttons, text input fields, and images, and they are designed to look and feel native on each platform (iOS or Android)


React Native also provides a set of APIs that allow you to access native device features like the camera, GPS, and more. This means you can build apps that can do things like take pictures, access the user's location, and more, without having to write any platform-specific code.

Overall, React Native is a powerful and flexible framework for building cross-platform mobile apps, and it is especially well-suited for building apps that need to share a lot of code between iOS and Android. By using React Native, you can build high-quality, native-feeling apps quickly and efficiently, without having to write separate codebases for each platform.
